                    <p>
                        We architect systems that surface operational patterns without evaluating them. Leaders see 
                        organizational health, execution benchmarks, and strategic alignment — and retain authority 
                        over interpretation.

                    <p>
                        Our platforms enforce structural fidelity while allowing operational flexibility. Decision 
                        frameworks follow defined schemas. Evidence logs maintain temporal integrity. Systems ensure 
                        completeness without constraining execution.

                    Impact Solutions Group operates two strategic intelligence platforms. ImpactOS serves executive teams

                    Both systems share the same architectural principles: surface reality, maintain fidelity, enable judgment.

                        Leaders generate analysis within governed schemas while maintaining interpretive authority.

                                Educators create timestamped records of instructional decisions. Each snapshot captures context, 
                                rationale, and intended approach. Teachers document their thinking. Substitutes access prior 
                                strategies. Coaches review patterns over time.

                                Structured logs connect observations to strategies. Educators mark what they see — student engagement, 
                                comprehension signals, behavioral patterns — building a temporal record without interpretation.

                                Different users see different interfaces. Teachers create snapshots. Tutors view teacher strategies 
                                and add their own. Substitutes inherit context. Coaches provide feedback across all documented strategies.

                                When personnel change, the platform preserves strategic context. New educators access prior snapshots, 
                                understand existing approaches, and contribute their own observations within the same structural framework.

                            Built for organizations managing distributed operations — charter networks, tutoring programs,

                    <div class="founder-bio">
                        <p>
                            I design intelligence systems for organizations that need to see their operations clearly without 
                            imposing external evaluation frameworks. My work focuses on structural integrity — ensuring data 
                            has temporal consistency, role-based access follows governance logic, and strategic documentation 
                            persists across personnel transitions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before founding Impact Solutions Group, I built evaluation infrastructure for New Jersey Tutoring Corps, 
                            serving 2,000+ students across 20+ sites. That work demonstrated that operational intelligence is most 
                            useful when it surfaces patterns without prescribing interpretations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ImpactOS and ClassroomOS emerged from that principle. Organizations operating at scale need systems 
                            that maintain fidelity to operational reality while allowing distributed decision-making. That's the 
                            work I do.

                <p>
                    Impact Solutions Group exists to build strategic intelligence infrastructure that respects human judgment. 
                    We create systems that document operational reality without evaluating it, maintain structural consistency 
                    without constraining flexibility, and scale across distributed environments without losing fidelity. Our 
                    platforms surface what's happening so leaders and educators can decide what it means.
